                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p id="text">
                        I am a self-motivated and driven individual who is always striving to improve and willing to
                        learn. From a young age, I have spent time learning and developing skills which I now use to
                        bring myself an income as a self-employed artist and designer online. During my time in
                        secondary school, I balanced my education with making comics which I published every
                        week, helping me to develop time management skills. I've always had an interest in
                        computers and video games, which have fueled my professional development and informed
                        my career choices. Along with developing artistic skills, I spent a lot of time growing up
                        developing technical skills relating to game development and am proficient in various
                        coding languages such as C#, HLSL, Java and Javascript, as well as some limited experience with C, C++ and Unreal Engine.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In my spare time, I like to work on a range of creative projects such as video editing, art, and
                        game development. I am currently using my skills to work on an experimental 3D game about
                        graffiti in the Unity engine where I have created all the assets myself, including 3D models
                        and shaders written in HLSL. I am also semi-fluent in French, having studied it up to A-Level
                        and continuing to study it in my spare time in the years since.

                            Graffiti Street is the project I worked on for my final dissertation at the University of Sussex. In this project, I aimed to create a game which utilises
                            modern technologies to provide the player with an environment in which they could interact with the game world by drawing onto it. It is for this reason that
                            the theme of graffiti was chosen.<br /> <br />
                            In this project, I handled all the programming, design, modelling and art myself. The project required me to learn how to create my own shaders in Unity through
                            the use of HLSL coding, in which I created the cel shader and outline shader you can see in the accompanying video. As previously mentioned, this project
                            was made with the Unity engine, meaning the majority of the code outside of shaders was written in C#. I also used my existing skills in Blender to create the
                            models which you can see in the game. Graffiti Street is in active development and is being updated outside of the scope of university, now that I have
                            graduated.<br />
                            <br />

                            Caff3.ine was a group project I worked on in my second year at the University of Sussex. We were tasked with an 8 month development cycle, in which time, we were
                            expected to produce a full, working game from conceptualisation to implementation. This project also required us to make a design document for the game.<br /><br />
                            As this project was done in a group, it taught me key communication and team work skills, as well as giving me an idea of how to work in a professional environment
                            through practices such as code reviews and version control via GitHub.<br /><br />
                            Throughout this project, I worked on greyboxing the level design, system logic in C#, programming UI and implementing JSON compatibility with the UI.

                            Snip and Shear was the submission my group and I made for Global Game Jam 2023, where the theme was "Roots". The team on this project was the same as Caff3.ine. <br /><br />
                            For this project, I wanted to take a break from programming and develop my skills in other areas, namely 3D modelling and animation, as I had just taught
                            myself Blender and was eager to expand my portfolio. I also lead the level design for this game, designing and modelling the game map entirely by myself.
                            When designing the level, I kept level design principles in mind and took inspiration from shooter games such as Halo and Team Fortress 2 when building the
                            level, which resulted in a level with a large focus on chokepoints and high-risk, high-reward collectables.<br /><br />

                            This project was made as a solo endeavour in the summer of 2022 between the end of my second year and the start of my final year at university. <br /><br />
                            At university, I had only been taught how to work with 3D and while I had prior experience with Unity 2D, I did not have experience working with spritesheets
                            and the animator component. This, combined with a desire to learn animation and develop my skills as a game artist lead me to making this proof of concept.
                            Ultimately, the project did not reach completion due to the sheer quantity of animation I would have had to do in order to turn it into a full commercial game,
                            however, I learned some useful skills and experimented with using Trello and Kanban boards for the first time to organise the development of the project.<br /><br />
                            Below you can see some concept art and animations used in the project.

                            Dual Runner was a group submission for Global Game Jam 2022, where the theme was "Duality". <br /><br />
                            Dual Runner's levels were designed to somewhat emulate that of  the classic Sonic the Hedgehog games. In its level design,
                            you can see design which splits the level into multiple paths, with the top path being harder to
                            stay on, but significantly faster, rewarding the player with the sensation of going fast. Additionally, when designing the game's mechanics, I
                            decided to use the level design to attempt to teach the mechanics to the player without a word of dialogue, introducing the player to a mechanic in
                            a safe environment first, then removing the safety net and building on the mechanic to create interesting and challenging level design.<br /><br />

                            Property Tycoon was a second year group project in which we were tasked as a group to create a digital version of the popular game Monopoly.<br /><br />
                            Recreating Monopoly meant working with an array-based solution in which each space on the game board was its own array object and derived from a parent class
                            which contained information such as the name, property value, position on the board and any purchased properties. This project required us to get this data and
                            load it in from an external file, which would allow for the board to be customised by the user with custom property names and prices, which is why you can see
                            the board loading up placeholder names before the game starts.<br /><br />
                            Other areas which had to be created included creating a dynamic UI which changes the position of the user's card on the screen depending on the number of players,
                            AI controlled players and the ability to load and save the game through the use of JSON files.<br /><br />

                            Ground Control was my submission for the GTMK 2020 game jam, where the theme was "Out of Control".<br /><br />
                            This game was my first fully realised project and my first proper endeavour into Unity and game development. In the game, the player must control
                            a satellite which needs to be positioned over a planet in order to receive data. However, the satellite is malfunctioning and will have a random effect
                            applied to it as it attempts to line itself up. These range from disabled thrusters to corrupted VRAM.<br /><br />

                        Between 2021 and 2022, I also co-owned and ran an eSports organisation titled "Horde Global" (<a href="https://twitter.com/HordeGlobal" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/HordeGlobal</a>), in which I produced graphic design, hosted
                        events, ran streams and ran the social media accounts. You can see work for this eSports org in the slideshow below.
